If set, a dialog is shown to the user to (soft) delete the point.
The dialog is built to be user friendly and to prevent mistakes.
If deletion is not possible, the dialog will hide itself and show the reason of non-deletability instead.

To configure, the following values are possible:

- false: never ever show the delete button
- true: show the default delete button
- undefined: use the mapcomplete default to show deletion or not. Currently, this is the same as 'false' but this will change in the future
- or: a hash with options (see below)

### The delete dialog



#### Hard deletion if enough experience

A feature can only be deleted from OpenStreetMap by mapcomplete if:

- It is a node
- No ways or relations use the node
- The logged-in user has enough experience OR the user is the only one to have edited the point previously
- The logged-in user has no unread messages (or has a ton of experience)
- The user did not select one of the 'non-delete-options' (see below)

In all other cases, a 'soft deletion' is used.

#### Soft deletion

A 'soft deletion' is when the point isn't deleted fromOSM but retagged so that it'll won't how up in the mapcomplete theme anymore.
This makes it look like it was deleted, without doing damage. A fixme will be added to the point.

Note that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme

##### No-delete options

In some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed "because the path is on their private property").
However, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice "hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)

The correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.
A no-delete option is offered as 'reason to delete it', but secretly retags.

Instead of running one query for every layer, the query is fused.

This implies that the _order_ of the layers is important in the case of features with the same tags;
as the later layers might never receive their feature.
*layers can also remove 'leftover'-features if the leftovers overlap with a feature in the layer itself
Note that builtin layers can be reused. Either put in the name of the layer to reuse, or use {builtin: "layername", override: ...}
The 'override'-object will be copied over the original values of the layer, which allows to change certain aspects of the layer

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

If set, a dialog is shown to the user to (soft) delete the point.
The dialog is built to be user friendly and to prevent mistakes.
If deletion is not possible, the dialog will hide itself and show the reason of non-deletability instead.
To configure, the following values are possible:
- false: never ever show the delete button
- true: show the default delete button
- undefined: use the mapcomplete default to show deletion or not. Currently, this is the same as 'false' but this will change in the future
- or: a hash with options (see below)
### The delete dialog
#### Hard deletion if enough experience
A feature can only be deleted from OpenStreetMap by mapcomplete if:
- It is a node
- No ways or relations use the node
- The logged-in user has enough experience OR the user is the only one to have edited the point previously
- The logged-in user has no unread messages (or has a ton of experience)
- The user did not select one of the 'non-delete-options' (see below)
In all other cases, a 'soft deletion' is used.
#### Soft deletion
A 'soft deletion' is when the point isn't deleted fromOSM but retagged so that it'll won't how up in the mapcomplete theme anymore.
This makes it look like it was deleted, without doing damage. A fixme will be added to the point.
Note that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme
##### No-delete options
In some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed "because the path is on their private property").
However, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice "hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)
The correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.

This brings in some troubles, as there are multiple ways to write it (no denomitation, 'm' vs 'meter' 'metre', ...)
Not only do we want to write consistent data to OSM, we also want to present this consistently to the user.
This is handled by defining units.
# Rendering
To render a value with long (human) denomination, use {canonical(key)}
# Usage
First of all, you define which keys have units applied, for example:
\`\`\`
units: [
 appliesTo: ["maxspeed", "maxspeed:hgv", "maxspeed:bus"]
 applicableUnits: [
     ...
 ]
]
\`\`\`
ApplicableUnits defines which is the canonical extension, how it is presented to the user, ...:
\`\`\`
applicableUnits: [
{
    canonicalDenomination: "km/h",
    alternativeDenomination: ["km/u", "kmh", "kph"]
    human: {
        en: "kilometer/hour",
        nl: "kilometer/uur"
    },
    humanShort: {
        en: "km/h",
        nl: "km/u"
    }
},
{
    canoncialDenomination: "mph",
    ... similar for miles an hour ...
}
]
\`\`\`
If this is defined, then every key which the denominations apply to (\`maxspeed\`, \`maxspeed:hgv\` and \`maxspeed:bus\`) will be rewritten at the metatagging stage:
every value will be parsed and the canonical extension will be added add presented to the other parts of the code.

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"

If set, a dialog is shown to the user to (soft) delete the point.
The dialog is built to be user friendly and to prevent mistakes.
If deletion is not possible, the dialog will hide itself and show the reason of non-deletability instead.
To configure, the following values are possible:
- false: never ever show the delete button
- true: show the default delete button
- undefined: use the mapcomplete default to show deletion or not. Currently, this is the same as 'false' but this will change in the future
- or: a hash with options (see below)
### The delete dialog
#### Hard deletion if enough experience
A feature can only be deleted from OpenStreetMap by mapcomplete if:
- It is a node
- No ways or relations use the node
- The logged-in user has enough experience OR the user is the only one to have edited the point previously
- The logged-in user has no unread messages (or has a ton of experience)
- The user did not select one of the 'non-delete-options' (see below)
In all other cases, a 'soft deletion' is used.
#### Soft deletion
A 'soft deletion' is when the point isn't deleted fromOSM but retagged so that it'll won't how up in the mapcomplete theme anymore.
This makes it look like it was deleted, without doing damage. A fixme will be added to the point.
Note that a soft deletion is _only_ possible if these tags are provided by the theme creator, as they'll be different for every theme
##### No-delete options
In some cases, the contributor might want to delete something for the wrong reason (e.g. someone who wants to have a path removed "because the path is on their private property").
However, the path exists in reality and should thus be on OSM - otherwise the next contributor will pass by and notice "hey, there is a path missing here! Let me redraw it in OSM!)
The correct approach is to retag the feature in such a way that it is semantically correct *and* that it doesn't show up on the theme anymore.

Sometimes, multiple denominations are possible (e.g. km/h vs mile/h; megawatt vs kilowatt vs gigawatt for power generators, ...)
This brings in some troubles, as there are multiple ways to write it (no denomitation, 'm' vs 'meter' 'metre', ...)
Not only do we want to write consistent data to OSM, we also want to present this consistently to the user.
This is handled by defining units.
# Rendering
To render a value with long (human) denomination, use {canonical(key)}
# Usage
First of all, you define which keys have units applied, for example:
\`\`\`
units: [
 appliesTo: ["maxspeed", "maxspeed:hgv", "maxspeed:bus"]
 applicableUnits: [
     ...
 ]
]
\`\`\`
ApplicableUnits defines which is the canonical extension, how it is presented to the user, ...:
\`\`\`
applicableUnits: [
{
    canonicalDenomination: "km/h",
    alternativeDenomination: ["km/u", "kmh", "kph"]
    human: {
        en: "kilometer/hour",
        nl: "kilometer/uur"
    },
    humanShort: {
        en: "km/h",
        nl: "km/u"
    }
},
{
    canoncialDenomination: "mph",
    ... similar for miles an hour ...
}
]
\`\`\`
If this is defined, then every key which the denominations apply to (\`maxspeed\`, \`maxspeed:hgv\` and \`maxspeed:bus\`) will be rewritten at the metatagging stage:
every value will be parsed and the canonical extension will be added add presented to the other parts of the code.

In the latter case, a correct text should be shown, but only a single, canonical tagging should be selectable by the user.
In this case, one of the mappings can be hiden by setting this flag.
To demonstrate an example making a default assumption:
mappings: [
 {
     if: "access=", -- no access tag present, we assume accessible
     then: "Accessible to the general public",
     hideInAnswer: true
 },
 {
     if: "access=yes",
     then: "Accessible to the general public", -- the user selected this, we add that to OSM
 },
 {
     if: "access=no",
     then: "Not accessible to the public"
 }
]
For example, for an operator, we have \`operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos\`, which is often abbreviated to \`operator=ANB\`.
Then, we would add two mappings:
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos" -- the non-abbreviated version which should be uploaded
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
},
{
    if: "operator=ANB", -- we don't want to upload abbreviations
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos"
    hideInAnswer: true
}
Hide in answer can also be a tagsfilter, e.g. to make sure an option is only shown when appropriate.
Keep in mind that this is reverse logic: it will be hidden in the answer if the condition is true, it will thus only show in the case of a mismatch
e.g., for toilets: if "wheelchair=no", we know there is no wheelchair dedicated room.
For the location of the changing table, the option "in the wheelchair accessible toilet is weird", so we write:
{
    "question": "Where is the changing table located?"
    "mappings": [
        {"if":"changing_table:location=female","then":"In the female restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=male","then":"In the male restroom"},
       {"if":"changing_table:location=wheelchair","then":"In the wheelchair accessible restroom", "hideInAnswer": "wheelchair=no"},
    ]
}
Also have a look for the meta-tags
{
    if: "operator=Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    then: "Maintained by Agentschap Natuur en Bos",
    hideInAnswer: "_country!=be"
